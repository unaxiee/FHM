Step 1: 'IDA/extract_feature.py' is executed by IDA Pro to generate assembly language for target functions given 'func_list.csv' for a specific package.
        'IDA/func_list' folder contains .csv files for each package extracted from vulnerability database.

Step 2: 'parse_harsh.py' is used to generate fuzzy hashing for assembly.
        It takes in one argument: package name.
        The inputs are from 'disasm_raw' and outputs are stored in 'disasm_hash'.

Step 3: 'evcaluate.py' is used to locate target functions in firmware given reference library.
        'util/func_lib' contains .csv files that map each function to a library in the package.
